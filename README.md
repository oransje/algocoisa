# Algorithms

A repository with some studies in algorithms, using CLRS as primary source.

Coded in C, because C is a very suitable language to learn about Data Structures and algorithms at a mid-level.

It has an arbitrary main execution for output validation of algorithms.

## Prerequisites

Just set the C compiler on makefile.
